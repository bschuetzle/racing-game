# Racing Game

This is a simple but fun game that pits a chicken against an egg in a friendly foot race (even though the egg doesn't have any feet).

## Installation

There are no extra installation requirements aside from a browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer.

## Usage

Click the Start button to start the countdown and move the competitors up to the starting line.
On 'Go!', click the 'q' key to advance the chicken and the 'z' key to advance the egg.
The first character to cross the finish line wins the race.
Hit the Reset button to queue them up back before the start line to start a new race.
